In problem 1 we need 
 
(a) the volume of the Earth in cubic miles 
(b) the volume of the Sun in cubic miles 
(c) the ratio of the volume of the Sun to the volume of the Earth 

 Where the radius and circle ratio are double. So, we put the double earth volume and double sun volume and divided them by each other. And then we added the earth volume and sun volume with cube miles, and the volume of the sun to the volume of earth added with ratio. Where we get the output of (4.0/3.0) (sunVolume / earthVolume) and the radius is 3. 
 
in problem 2, This is the problem where we need to find the which root will give us the nValues=50; 
And the answer we got by the squreroot that we will get the nValue with the outerloop.

in problem 3 

We used the string and character in the public void. In this text the text continued with vowels. To get more text we need to increase the number of vowels.
